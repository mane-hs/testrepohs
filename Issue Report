Issue report 2: Nodes are rearranged over each other

OS - Windows, Mac, Chrome Browser

Description: When adding a list of nodes then clicking one to expand not, rearranged nodes are placed over each other, 
             which makes some of them invisible, and random parameters of a massive of nodes can be the same.

Steps to reproduce: 1. Navigate to http://104.248.248.105:8085/
                                 2. Click on Add Node (~20) button to add nodes on the canvas.
                                 3. Double click on a single node to expand it.
Expected result: When the node is expanded a new node is created which is linked to the parent node with an arrow.
Actual result: all nodes are rearranged, some are placed over one another or the links become invisible 
               (please see the screenshots attached: Capture1.png, Capture2.png).
